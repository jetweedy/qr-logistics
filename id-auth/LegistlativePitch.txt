Policy Brief: Digital Age-Verified Speed Pass Pilot for North Carolina
The Problem

NC venues, bars, and festivals must manually inspect physical IDs for alcohol sales and 21+ entry.

Manual checks cause slow lines, rely heavily on staff judgment, and allow fake IDs to slip through.

Venues face serious penalties if underage patrons are admitted.

Patrons increasingly expect digital, mobile-first options.

The Proposal

Authorize a Digital Age-Verified Speed Pass Pilot in which:

Users: Register once through a secure identity verification process (approved vendor + DMV data).

Pass: Receive a QR code tied to a verified selfie and date of birth.

At the gate: Staff scan the QR, see the verified selfie + green/red age result, and visually compare the photo to the patron.

Compliance: Staff may request a physical ID at any time; random spot checks included.

Key Principles

Physical ID remains valid ‚Äî venues are required to accept licenses, passports, and military IDs.

Digital pass is optional ‚Äî an express lane for faster entry, not a replacement.

Privacy by design ‚Äî no SSNs or license numbers stored; only a selfie and verified DOB.

Audit trail ‚Äî every scan is logged, giving regulators stronger evidence of compliance.

Benefits

For venues: Faster throughput, fewer fake IDs, reduced liability.

For patrons: Convenience, no fumbling with IDs, modern user experience.

For regulators: Stronger compliance evidence, better enforcement tools.

For NC: Potential new revenue stream ‚Äî DMV could license API access (e.g., $5/year/user ‚Üí $5M+ if 1M residents opt in).

Pilot Program

Partner with 1‚Äì2 NC venues for a 90-day trial.

Collect data on speed, compliance, and user satisfaction.

Report back to NC ABC Commission, DMV, and ALE.

Legislative Ask

Authorize a Digital Age Verification Pilot under NC ABC law.

Allow DMV to provide secure API verification of DOB + photo match for approved vendors.

Require physical ID acceptance remain mandatory.

Evaluate pilot results after 12 months for possible statewide adoption.

üìå Bottom Line: This pilot is a safe, revenue-positive innovation that strengthens compliance, modernizes patron experience, and positions North Carolina as a national leader in digital ID adoption.

üìë Digital Age-Verified Speed Pass Pilot
Stronger Compliance ‚Ä¢ Faster Lines ‚Ä¢ New Revenue for NC
‚öñÔ∏è The Problem

Venues must manually inspect physical IDs for 21+ entry and alcohol sales.

Slow and subjective: lines are long, staff judgment varies, fake IDs slip through.

Compliance risk: underage admissions expose venues to fines, license suspensions, and liability.

Lost opportunity: NC could lead on digital ID but is behind other states moving toward mobile driver‚Äôs licenses.

üí° The Proposal

Authorize a Digital Age-Verified Speed Pass Pilot under NC ABC law.

Patrons pre-verify once through an approved ID verification vendor (with DMV data support).

They get a QR code pass tied to a verified selfie + DOB.

At the gate: staff scan ‚Üí see verified photo + green/red age status ‚Üí quick visual match.

Physical IDs remain valid and must be accepted ‚Äî this is supplemental, not a replacement.

üîí Compliance & Security

Meets existing law: staff retain authority to request physical ID at any time.

Audit trails: each scan is logged (timestamp, token, device ID) for enforcement review.

Privacy-by-design: no SSNs or license numbers stored; only verified photo + yes/no shared.

Spot checks: random physical ID checks built into the pilot to ensure compliance.

üí∞ Benefits to North Carolina

For regulators: Stronger enforcement evidence, fewer fake IDs, improved compliance.

For venues: Faster entry, happier customers, reduced liability.

For patrons: Convenience, less waiting, safer nightlife.

For NC government:

Licensing fees for verification API access.

Example: $5/user/year √ó 1M users = $5M+ annual revenue stream.

Positions NC as a national leader in digital ID innovation.

üõ† Pilot Program

Duration: 12 months.

Scope: 1‚Äì2 partner venues (concert hall, festival).

Evaluation: throughput speed, compliance incidents, user/staff satisfaction.

Report back: to NC ABC, DMV, and ALE for consideration of expansion.

üìå Bottom Line:
This pilot is a low-risk, revenue-positive innovation. It strengthens compliance, modernizes patron experience, and positions North Carolina as a leader in digital identity adoption ‚Äî while keeping physical IDs mandatory and valid.
