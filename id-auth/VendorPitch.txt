Digital Age-Verified Express Lane Pilot

(Vendor-Facing Pitch for Bars, Clubs, Venues)

Why This Matters to You

Lines are long, customers get frustrated. Faster entry = more time (and money) spent inside.

Fake IDs are everywhere. Staff miss some, and you carry the legal risk.

Compliance penalties are serious. NC ALE/ABC can fine you, suspend your permit, or shut you down.

What We’re Offering

A free pilot program that adds a Digital Express Lane at your door.

Patrons who pre-verify once (with a trusted ID verification partner) get a QR pass on their phone.

At the door, staff scan the QR → see a verified photo and a simple green/red age result.

Staff do a quick visual match of the photo to the person, just like an ID check.

Key Points for Your Peace of Mind

Physical IDs still work — and you can always demand one. The Express Lane is optional and supplemental.

Random spot checks are built in, so you stay compliant with NC law.

No sensitive data is stored on your side. You only see the verified photo + yes/no result.

Audit logs provide evidence you did your due diligence — stronger than today’s manual checks.

No cost to you for the pilot. We handle the tech; you just dedicate a tablet/phone for scanning.

Benefits to Your Venue

Shorter lines = happier customers. People spend less time outside, more time buying drinks inside.

Reduced liability. Stronger verification means fewer minors sneak in.

Modern, tech-savvy image. Position your venue as forward-thinking, safer, and customer-friendly.

Easy implementation. Staff only need minimal training. No extra hardware purchases required for the pilot.

What We Need From You

Willingness to let us run a 60- to 90-day pilot at your venue.

A dedicated line (“Express Pass Lane”) for participants.

Cooperation in collecting feedback from staff and patrons.

The Ask

We’d like to partner with your venue as an early adopter. You’ll get:

Free setup and support,

Priority positioning if/when this becomes a statewide program,

Input into shaping a system that could eventually reduce your compliance risk — and your costs.

📌 Bottom Line for You:
This is not a replacement for your ID checks. It’s a risk-reducing, line-shortening tool — at no cost to your venue — that shows your customers you care about their time and safety.
